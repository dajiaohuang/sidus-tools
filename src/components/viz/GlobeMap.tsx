 * Follow-at-altitude camera pullback.
 *
 * A true 3D chase camera behind the satellite would need MapLibre's
 * FreeCameraOptions/setFreeCameraOptions API, confirmed ABSENT from
 * MapLibre GL JS entirely (grepped the real Camera class source for v5.24.0
 * and v6.4.1 for FreeCamera/setFreeCameraOptions/lookAtPoint: zero matches
 * in either, and none on the official Map API docs page). It is a Mapbox GL
 * JS-only API that MapLibre has never implemented, in any projection.
 * Related upstream limit: GlobeTransform ignores center elevation entirely
 * (MercatorTransform uses it explicitly, GlobeTransform never does), and a
 * mercator-projection workaround was tried and rejected because a
 * constant-altitude orbit on a flat world reads as a self-intersecting
 * floating sinusoid. Follow therefore stays globe ground-centered.
 *
 * The chase is therefore ground-centered, and the entry shot pulls the zoom
 * back as altitude increases so the elevated track has headroom at a steep
 * pitch. A framing preference, kept as named constants so it stays easy to
 * retune on sight; the hard limit is the zoom ceiling further down.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Centring the elevated dot while following.
 *
 * MapLibre centres on GROUND coordinates, but with the altitude layer on the
 * dot the user sees is drawn 400+ km up, and that elevated point projects away
 * from the ground point beneath it: measured 41 px at pitch 20 and 290 px at
 * pitch 80, always along screen Y, which is why the camera looked like it
 * trailed the satellite. The camera therefore aims PAST the satellite, at the
 * ground its centre ray reaches after passing through it.
 *
 * How far past is solved exactly, per frame, for the pose the user is holding:
 * see elevatedCenterLeadRad in globe/camera.ts. There is no feedback loop and
 * no gain, so a tilt or a turn cannot leave a one-frame error behind, which is
 * what a cross-frame correction showed as a small jump on every pose change.
 *
 * The zoom ceiling is the one thing tilt really does cost. The aiming ray only
 * reaches the ground while the camera is farther from Earth's centre than the
 * satellite is, and the camera's height above the centre point goes with
 * cos(pitch), so a steep tilt has to be paid for with a wider shot. Tilt itself
 * is never refused.
